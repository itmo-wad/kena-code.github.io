In my Frontend part, I created a static profile page about yourself in HTML and CSS that look like a simple CV.

In my basic Backend part, I served the frontend profile page at default route ('/').

In the advanced part, I Served the profile page using render_template with parameters names, age and location at '/profile' and redirect default route to it.
