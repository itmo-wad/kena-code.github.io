In this project, i create a profile page with my own informations and my photo. For my backend task, I serve the static profile page at default route ('/') and I serve the image and the CSS files as static resources ikn a stactic folder that i created.

At the end, I served the profile page at '/profile' using render_template with parameters names age and location and redirect default route to it.
